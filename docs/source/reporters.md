## Builtin Runner Names

* "summary": [Summary Reporter](#summary-reporter)
* "not_found": [Not Found Reporter](#not-found-reporter)

## Summary Reporter

The summary reporter prints a list of basic statistics about the testing.  

Example Report:
```text
*** Results Summary ***
Testing found 50.0% of Mutants.
 - 10 mutant(s) were not found.
 - 10 mutant(s) caused trial to timeout.
 - 10 mutant(s) could not be tested due to an error.
```

## Not Found Reporter

The "Not Found" Reporter prints a list of all mutations that were not found.
It includes information about the Mutation, and any error messages generated by the testing tool.

Example Report:
```text
*** Mutants Not Found ***

Mutant Trial Result: Mutant Not Found
Mutator: String
