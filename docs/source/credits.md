## Inspiration

When I was looking for a Python Mutation Testing tool, the top candidates I found were [Mutmut](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io) and [Mutatest](https://mutatest.readthedocs.io/).  Both are good tools with pros and cons of each.  I decided to create my own tool because I wanted a more configurable tool, that is able to run multiple trials in parallel.  I considered submitting updates to one or the other, but found that what I wanted would be nearly a rewrite.  By starting over new, I was able to utilize new tools, some that weren't part of python's base till version 3.9.

## Tools
